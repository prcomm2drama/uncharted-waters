                    This winter, the Cornish College of the Arts Theater and Performance Production Departments, Seattle University Theatre, and the University of Washington School of Drama will come together for a cross-town theatrical collaboration the likes of which Seattle has never seen. Seattle University’s Rosa Joshi (Bring Down the House, Oregon Shakespeare Festival, upstart crow collective) directs William Shakespeare’s Twelfth Night, while Cornish College of the Arts’ Sheila Daniels (Indecent, Seattle Rep; The Wolves, ACT Theatre) and UW Drama acting alum Porscha Shaw (Nina Simone: Four Women, Seattle Rep; Saint Joan, ArtsWest) co-direct a devised piece in response to themes in Shakespeare’s play. Both productions will feature student casts from all three schools, and the artistic and production work of students, faculty, and staff from all three schools, and both will be rehearsed and performed entirely online. We invite the community to join us as we meet the challenges of isolation with radical togetherness.
